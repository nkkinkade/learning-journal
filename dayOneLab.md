## Explain Growth Mindset

The __Growth Mindset__ is seeing obstacles as challenges. It's persistance. That part of you that seeks new challenges, that refuses to accept defeat. It's knowing that things may be tough, but nothing is going to change unless you change it. It's a way of thinking that gets you to your goals.


## Three reminders of how to keep in a Growth Mindset
- Mistakes will be made, learn from them
- There is _always_ a way
- No one has all the answers in the beginning
