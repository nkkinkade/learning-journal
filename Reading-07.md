# Programming with JavaScript

## Scripts
* Computers can only do exactly what they are told to do
* A script is a series of instructions that tell a computer how to accomplish a task
* Scripts are designed like a recipe with ordered commands that must be followed

## Expressions and Operators
* Expressions evaluate into a single value and come in two types:
    * Expressions that just assign a value to a variable
    * Expressions that use two or more values to return a single value
* Operators allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values
* Arithmetic Operators deal with math Examples: +, -, /, *
* String Operators use quotation marks with text inside

## Functions
* Functions are reusable series of statements within JavaScript put together to perform a specific task
* Functions are executed when they are called, this is known as invoking a function
